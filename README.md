### What is this
This is a simple webapp for a travel agency. It allows the user to select a holiday package, and then choose a hotel in that location. Final page should display a short summary of previous choices.

I wanted to get some practice with Material UI and refresh my design skills, and this works great for both.

### Current status
About 90% of the front-end is done â€“ only the final page remains. Enabled simple filtering on the Hotels page, based on previous selection and user-selected filters. 

### Setup
Use `npm run` to start the app.
