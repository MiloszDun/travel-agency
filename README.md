### What is this
This is a simple webapp for a travel agency.

I wanted to get some practice with Material UI and refresh my design skills â€“ this was a great project for both of them.

After the welcome page, user can choose one of several holiday packages:

![Package Selection Page](src/img/screenshoots/Package-selection.png?raw=true "Package Selection Page")

Based on the package selected, user will see different hotels available.

(Hotel filtering is based on location.)

On top of that, user can filter the results based on several tags.

Finally, user will see a short summary page, confirming previous choices and allowing them to pay.

(Pay Now button doesn't actually do anything.)

### Setup
Use `npm run` to start the app.
